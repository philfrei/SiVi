<h1>Flames - using noise to modulate a function</i></h1>

<h2>Click on the graphic to load settings into the Texture Editing 
tool.</h2>

<p><i>In this example, we will look at the technique of using the 
noise values to modulate a gradient along the y-axis, given by the
function f(y) = y / height. The same idea can be used to modulate 
other functions such as f(x) = x / width, or vertical or horizontal
uses of trig functions including radial gradients.</i></p> 

<p>The following code will create a <code>BufferedImage</code> that 
matches the above graphic. A template has been provided (see the 
"Code Template" button) where you can copy and paste this code 
and run it as a stand-alone Java program. You will also need to 
load the ColorMap class, which can be obtained via the "ColorMap 
Source" button. Code lines that are different from previous examples
are <b>bolded</b>.</p>

                          * ( octaveAmplitude[i]/amplitudeSum );
                }

<p>This code illustrates an implementation of the technique of using
noise to modulate another function. One of the most common functions
subjected to noise modulation is a color gradient. Color gradients 
are useful enough that Java2D includes a GradientPaint and a 
RadialGradientPaint class. Here, we will calculate and draw the 
gradient explicitly, using a ColorMap that transitions from a nice 
bright yellow to a medium red to a background blue color. Then, we 
will alter (modulate) the gradient by adding in a noise component.</p> 

<p>Much of this code should be familiar. In fact, I only had to bold
three new lines of code for concepts not implemented in previous 
examples. The first is the declaration of a new variable where we 
will hold a factor to use to control the <i>strength</i> of the noise
component: <code>noiseAmplitude</code>.</p>

<p>As before, we iterate through the <i>octaves</i>, here set up to 
be stretched in the vertical direction, and compute a <code>noiseSum
</code> value. This value will have the range of -1 to 1. Then, we
will multiply this value by <code>noiseAmplitude</code> to scale it
to a range that will give us the desired amount of modulation.</p>

<p>The expression <code>y / (float)height</code> gives us the 
gradient component, scaled to a normalized range (0 to 1). The <code>
float</code> cast is used to prevent integer division, necessary 
since both the <code>Y</code> iterator and the <code>height</code> 
variable are integers. This expression returns a value that goes 
from 0 to 1 as we move down the image.</p>

<p>Below is a graphic that shows what we would have if we only had  
the <code>Y</code> component, and no noise. You can see this in the
Texture Tool by turning all the stage one mixer sliders down to 0, 
or by assigning <code>0</code> to <code>noiseAmplitude</code> in the
sample code.</p>

<p><i><b>Fig. 1, Y-oriented gradient, with zero noise modulation
</b></i></p>
<img SRC="../images/flamesGradient.JPG" width="700" height="160" 
hspace="0" vspace="0" ALT="Flames gradient with zero noise"/>

<p>Since the y-gradient is normalized, and the noise value is in the
range -1 to 1, mixing them together would result in a range that 
goes from -1 to 2, and in which the noise component would be twice
as large as the gradient it was supposed to be modulating. You can 
alter the code example to see what this looks like by making <code>
noiseAmplitude</code> equal 1, and putting in a proper translate and 
scale so that the -1 to 2 range can map into the 256 positions of 
the color map.</p>

<p>After playing around, I decided that 0.33 was a nice amount by 
which to scale the noise component. As a result, the noise values 
will now range from -0.33 to 0.33, and so, will not swamp the
normalized gradient. The resulting range will be from -0.33 to 1.33,
so we will still have to manage the mapping to 0 to 255.</p>

<p>Amid the many possibilities, I decided to take the course of 
action of <i>clamping</i>, as can be seen by the presence of the 
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions. The over-exposure 
quality of the yellow that results seems to me to communicate a sense
of high heat, so that works out well.</p>
