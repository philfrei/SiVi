<h1>Tree Rings Effect - cycling vs. clamping</i></h1>

<h2>Click on the graphic to load settings into the Texture Editing 
tool.</h2>

<p><i>This section looks at various things that can happen when you 
expand the returned noise values beyond the range of -1 to 1, then 
use another operation to bring the values to normalization. One 
method uses a form of modular division, resulting in a set 
of rings through the color space, sometimes likened to tree
rings. You will also see an alternative method for bringing noise
values into normalization range: a </i>clamping<i> technique which 
produces an effect that reminds me of over-exposed light.</i></p>

<p>The following code will create a <code>BufferedImage</code> that 
matches the above graphic. A template has been provided (see the 
"Export" button) where you save code that will generate a texture and
run it as a stand-alone Java program. Code lines that are different
from previous examples are <b>bolded</b>.</p>

<pre> 
        BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(width, height,
                BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);
        WritableRaster raster = image.getRaster();

        int[] pixel = new int[4]; 
        <b>pixel[2] = 0; // blue, none used</b>
        pixel[3] = 255; // alpha channel, always opaque

        <b>// dark brown = Color(64, 32, 0)
        int redA = 64;
        int greenA = 32;
    
        // medium brown = Color(128, 96, 0)
        int redB = 128;
        int greenB = 96;

        int rings = 4;</b>
        
        double noiseValue;

        for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++)
        {
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++)
            {
                noiseValue = SimplexNoise.noise(x/128f, y/128f);
                <b>noiseValue *= rings; 
                noiseValue = noiseValue - Math.floor(noiseValue);

                pixel[0] = (int)(noiseValue * (redB - redA) + redA);
                pixel[1] = (int)(noiseValue * (greenB - greenA) 
                             + greenA);</b>

                raster.setPixel(x, y, pixel);
            }
        }
</pre>

<p><U><b>Rings</b></U></p>

<p>In the above sample code, at the heart of the <code>for</code>
loops, the variable <code>noiseValue</code> is given a value in the 
range of -1.0 to 1.0 by the Simplex noise function, exactly as we 
had done in the previous tutorial section. Then, this value is 
amplified to the range of -4 to 4 in the very next line, by 
multiplying it by the <code>rings</code> variable.</p>

<p>The value is then brought back into normalization range by using a 
function similar to modular division by 1, which creates a remainder
that repeatedly cycles through the range 0 to 1.</p>

<p>Instead of modular division by one, we use the Math.floor() 
function, in which the return value is always the first integer less
than or equal to the argument. When the <i>floor</i> value is 
subtracted from the original noiseValue, the result will always be 
in the range 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1. A similar
result occurs via modular division by 1. But with modular 
division, you must make special provisions for negative noise 
values, as the remainders will also be negative and will progress in
the opposite direction than the remainders of positive noise values. 
The following chart illustrates this.</p>

      1.2          0.2            0.2
</pre>
 
<p><i>[According to Stefan Gustavson: the following achieves the 
same results, but is faster than the Math.floor() function:</i></p>
<pre>    n = (n < 0)? (int)(n + 1) : (int)n; </pre>
<p><i>But I will leave the floor function in the demo code for the
sake of clarity.]</i></p>

<p>Of course, you may <i>want</i> to have the color rings oriented
in opposing directions, in which case modular division by 1 would
be perfectly appropriate. Or one might translate the entire range
into the positive number space (by adding 4 in this case) prior to 
the modular division and thus avoid the need to deal with negatives. 
This just goes to show a basic truth, which is that there are 
innumerable techniques for operating on the noise values, as long as 
you eventually end up with a range that can be mapped to legal colors.</p>

<p>In this example we map to a color range bounded by two shades of 
brown. The darker brown has a Red value of 64 and a Green value of 
32. The lighter has a Red value of 128 and a Green value of 96. To 
scale our normalized values, we use a standard formula: multiply the
normalized value by the difference of the two target values, and add 
the result to the first value.</p>

<p>This following line of code from the example does this for the 
green channel:</p>
<pre>
    colorValue = (int)(noiseValue * (greenB - greenA) + greenA);
</pre>

<p>In our example, the desired range is 96 - 32 = 64. Thus we 
multiply the normalized <code>noiseValue</code> by 64, then add it
to 32. Thus, the result will equal 32 if the noise Value is 0 or 96 
if it is 1, or an intermediate green value for all noise values in
between 0 and 1.</p>

<p><U><b>Clamps</b></U></p>

<p>Another way to ensure that we don't try to assign out-of-range 
values to pixel colors is to run the noise Values through a 
<code>min</code> and a <code>max</code> function.</p>

<pre>
    noiseValue = Math.max(noiseValue, 0);
    noiseValue = Math.min(noiseValue, 1);
    colorValue = (int)(noiseValue * (greenB - greenA) + greenA);
</pre>

<p><i>[Some prefer to combine the Max and Min functions into a single
line, though I suspect the latest Java compilers automatically handle
this optimization for us.]</i></p>

<p>In the following figure, we use the same the noise values that 
have been multiplied by <code>rings</code>, and range from -4 to 4.
Only now, only the values that are within the range 0 to 1 result in 
intermediate brown colors. Values from -4 to 0 display the darker
brown, and values from 1 to 4 display as the lighter brown.</p>

<p><U><b>Using the Texture Tool example</b></U></p>

<h2>Clicking on the graphic loads the Texture Editing tool with 
settings that will generate the graphic, and this tutorial window 
will disappear. To bring back the tutorial at any time, click on 
the "Tutorial" button on the bottom center right of the tool.</h2>

<p>Because of a design decision with the Texture Tool, I had to be
a little tricky to create the "overflow" condition that allows us to
transform the data to where the <i>rings</i> or <i>clamp</i> effects
are possible. You will notice that the Tool presents four channels of
the graphic, and that all four channels are set to "64" in the mixer.
</p>

<p><i><b>Fig. 3, Mixer settings for the Rings effect.</b></i></p>
<img SRC="../images/treeRingMixer.JPG" width="595" height="260" 
hspace="10" vspace="10" ALT="Clamping example"/>

<p>The mixer programmed so that the actual value that is used
is the number present on the slider divided by 64. Thus a single 
channel can't cause an overflow. To achieve an overflow, we have the
four channels each add it's 100% to a total sum. This is equivalent 
mathematically to the code example where we multiply the noise value
by a <code>rings</code> factor of 4. If you draw down the individual
slider volumes, you can see the rings effect lessen.</p>

<p>You can also lessen the number of rings by selecting the "smooth"
normalization in the contributing channels. If all the channels are
set to "(v+1)/2", then the data will range purely from 0 to 4,
allowing a max of 4 rings. With "none" selected, the data can
range from -4 to 4, allowing a maximum of 8 rings.</p> 

<p>Note that 2nd stage of the mixer is set to "ring". With this 
setting, the Math.floor function is performed on the data from stage
1. There are two other settings on this slider. One can select "add" 
or "lerp". With "add", all the 2nd stage tracks being combined have 
their individual track values added into a grand sum that is then 
clamped. With "lerp" the contributing tracks are averaged together, 
their weights being determined by the values of the stage 2 sliders.
</p>

<p>The light green label at the left of the stage 2 slider lists 
which tracks are contributing. The selection of contributing tracks 
is determined automatically, based upon the Color Bar selected for 
the channel (top color gradient graphic on the channel stacks in the
top half of the tool). The 2nd stage also splits out channels by
the function selected in the stage 1 mixer (e.g., "add", "lerp", 
"sin", "xDim", "yDim"--choices available as of this iteration).</p>

<p>One last note: one can cause an "underflow" by selecting "none" 
instead of either the "smooth" or "turbulent" normalization options,
via the channel radio buttons. Selecting "none" allows values from 
-1 to 0 to reach the function which converts the numbers to color
data. If the 2nd stage setting is "ring", the underflow will appear 
as a single ring. If the 2nd stage setting is either "add" or "lerp"
the data will be clamped and all values below zero will be reported as
zero.</p>
