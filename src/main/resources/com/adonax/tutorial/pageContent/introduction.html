<h1><U>Preface</U></h1>

<p>This tutorial app is aimed at Java game programmers wishing to 
learn how to code their own gradient-noise textures. Included is 
a selection of basic 2D textures with explanations, sample code,
and a hands-on tool that allows one to fiddle with the settings. 
The tool can be invoked by clicking on the graphic placed on the 
top of each tutorial page.</p>

<p>I initially built the texture editing tool as a way to better
understand how to work with textures, to test out ideas. For 
example, many tutorials emphasize the use of a fractal 
progressions, sometimes referred to as <i>octaves</i> when 
assembling textures (discussed in the "Fluffy Clouds -- Sum noise" 
section). While this proves to be a very useful concept, I found 
myself questioning whether it was <i>always</i> the best way to go. 
Thus, the tool <i>also</i> allows one to put in settings that do 
<i>not</i> have the harmonic relationships found in fractals. 
In short, there are more streamlined, more advanced tools 
available, but this one has given me a good start at procedural 
texture building, and I think it can for you, too.</p>

<p>Those wishing to learn more about algorithms used to generate
gradient noise, and about the Simplex algorithm in particular,
should check out Stefan Gustavson's excellent article: "Simplex noise 
demystified" from 2005-03-22. <code>
[http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf]</code>
</p>

<p>In fact, I am using Gustavson's reference implementation 
(rev. 2012-03-09) of Ken Perlin's Simplex Noise, and wish to express
thanks to both for putting these ideas and tools into public domain.</p>
