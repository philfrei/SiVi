<h1>Classic Fluffy Clouds - Sum 1/f noise</i></h1>

<h2>Click on the graphic to load settings into the Texture Editing 
tool.</h2>

<p><i>The technique employed here sums together the return values 
of multiple calls to the noise function, using a fractal sequence.
Each call to the noise function is scaled by a value that has twice 
the scaling factor of the preceding call. These scaling values are 
termed "octaves". The return values are added together 
according to a weighting formula that gives each octave half the 
weight of the preceding octave.</i></p> 

<p>The following code will create a <code>BufferedImage</code> that 
matches the above graphic. A template has been provided (see the 
"Code Template" button) where you can copy and paste this code and
run it as a stand-alone Java program. Code lines that are different
from previous examples are <b>bolded</b>.</p>

        // the blue value is always at maximum
        pixel[2] = 255; // blue
        pixel[3] = 255; // opaque

<p>This code illustrates an implementation of the concept "Sum 1/f 
Noise" presented by Ken Perlin in his "Making Noise" lecture from 
1999. <code>[http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/index.html]</code></p> 

<p>Perlin gives a fractal sequence: </p>

<pre>    noise(p) + (1/2)*noise(2p) + (1/4)*noise(4p) ...</pre>

<p>and suggests that the sequence need go no more than to the point 
where the results would be too small to see.</p> 

<p>Many of the blogs I've seen refer to each of these elements as 
an "octave," borrowing conceptually from the physics of music. The 
analogy may be apt, but also has implications that might lead us to 
overlook possibilities if followed too rigidly. I will write on 
this topic some more, below.</p>

<p>In the code example, the fractal sequence is loaded into an array 
of scaling values (<code>octaveScale</code>) and of weights
(<code>octaveAmplitude</code>). The values in these arrays are 
accessed in the innermost loop and the result is summed into <code>
noiseSum</code>.</p>

<p>In order to make the sequence of noise calls sum up to a maximum 
of 100% while obeying the "halving influence" formula, we take the 
sum of all the amplitude weights in the <code>octaveAmplitude</code>
array and use that as a denominator when calculating the relative 
weight contribution from each octave. The sum of our fractal 
sequence is 15 (equal to 1 + 2 + 4 + 8). So, our returned noise 
values are weighted as follows: 8/15, 4/15, 2/15, 1/15. When 
combined, the four values will result in a single value that will 
lie within the output range of -1 to 1.</p>

<p>For clouds effects, the <i>smooth noise</i> quality is usually 
preferred, so the "(v + 1)/2"  transform is applied to normalize the 
data. Then, we multiply the resulting value by 256 and apply an 
<code>int</code> cast to bring the value down to a maximum of 255.</p>

<p>Blue is always 255 in this graphic. When Red and Green are 0, the 
resulting color is Blue, and when Red and Green are 255, the 
resulting color is White. The noise values are used to modulate 
the Red and Green channels.</p>

<p>If desired, one can add more (or have less) octaves by adding 
or taking away members of the two octave arrays. The graphic 
at the top of the page uses five octaves. I've also run the above 
code with six and seven octaves. For the seven-octave case, one can 
fill the two arrays with the following data:</p>

<pre>
    int[] octaveScale = {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128};
    int[] octaveAmplitude = {64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1};
</pre>

<p>On my setup at home, I have a great deal of trouble 
distinguishing between the five- and six-octave cases, let alone 
the seventh. But I haven't determined, conclusively, what the 
limiting factor is. Perlin mentions the width of a pixel, but we 
could also be dealing with the relative amplitude of the last 
factor being swamped.</p>

<p>Another consideration that occurs to me is that there is 
probably a "Nyquist" upper limit to the effectiveness of the 
algorithm. If the noise has a given frequency (due to the regular 
spacing of the gradient grid) and a scaling factor that exceeds 
half this frequency, the results could devolve into a more chaotic 
noise or some Moire-type pattern or aliasing (in the audio sense).
</p>

<p>But I will leave the question of what the upper scaling limit 
might be to someone with the math skills to calculate a theoretical 
limit.

<p><b>Using the Texture Editing tool</b></p>

<h2>Clicking on the graphic loads the Texture Editing tool with 
settings that will generate the graphic, and this tutorial window 
will disappear. To bring back the tutorial at any time, click on 
the "Tutorial" button on the bottom center right of the tool.</h2>

<p>The first thing I'd like to point out is that there is nothing 
"magical" about the X & Y values all starting at (0, 0) as far as 
the "Sum 1/f noise" algorithm is concerned. If you translate any 
of the channels, the specific result will vary, but it will always 
have the same degree of randomness. You can test this by 
manipulating the "Translation" sliders on the tool.</p>

<p>The second thing I'd like to point out is that the scaling need 
not be exactly in harmonic ratios. Acceptable clouds can be 
obtained with different scale settings, whereas in music physics, 
deviations from exact harmonic ratios can lead to considerable 
discord. The third thing to point out is that the relative weights 
need not be exact ratios either. One can experiment with this by
fiddling with the stage 1 section of sliders, which determine the 
relative weights of the various channels.</p>

<p>Thus, the "octaves" metaphor shouldn't be taken too 
literally. <i>[I blame my Music Theory background for this 
"oversensitivity" to the use of the term "octaves".]</i> However,
there are still good justifications for this concept. The construct
allows for a very compact way of coding calls to the noise function 
(using the iterator to generate successive powers of two), and there
is much in nature that is fractal in structure. </p>

<p><b>A Cirrus clouds texture</b></p>

<p>Clouds come in many shapes and sizes. I'd like to spend a little
time now demonstrating how one can edit the basic Fluffy Clouds 
settings and obtain some delicately textured cirrus clouds.</p>

<p>Cirrus clouds tend to be long and flat, so one step is to change
the scaling. I like the ratio of 1 to 8 for this effect, and set up
four channels scaling factors as follows: (1) x = 0.5, y = 4; 
(2) x = 1, y = 8; (3) x = 2, y = 16; (4) x = 2, y = 32. This gives
us the following graphic:</p>

<p><i><b>Fig. 1a, Cirrus clouds from Classic clouds, stretching
the horizontal to vertical scaling to a 1:8 ratio.</b></i></p>
<img SRC="../images/cirrusStep1.JPG" width="265" height="265" hspace="10"
vspace="10" ALT="Cirrus Step 1"/>

<p>This looks quite nice, but I think I want to have less clouds, 
and more blue sky. To accomplish this, I am going to take advantage
of the clamping function, and mix in some non-normalized signal. 
Since half the non-normalized signal falls below zero, there should
be areas where the sum will also fall below zero. Given the clamping,
these areas will become the first color value in our color mapping 
function, which in this case is blue.</p>

<p>Thus, on channel 0 (the leftmost), select the "none" option from 
the radio buttons between the sliders and the channel graphic. In 
coding this, you would have to change your program to segregate the 
first channel's return value from the rest of the channels and 
wait until after they have been summed and normalized via the smooth
function before adding them in.</p>

<p><i><b>Fig. 1b, Cirrus clouds from Classic clouds, adding blue
sky by lowering the sums and clamping.</b></i></p>
<img SRC="../images/cirrusStep2.JPG" width="265" height="265" 
hspace="10" vspace="10" ALT="Cirrus Step 2"/>

<p>Now, I'd like to introduce a bit of the thread-like quality
to these clouds. To do so, I'm going to use the highest channel 
to inject some <i>turbulent</i> noise. Simply clicking the "|v|" 
radio button on the 4th channel (channel "3") will add an interesting 
level of detail, but notice how the fold in the noise texture is 
centered on blue. I'd like to have these fold lines be white instead.
This can be done by flipping the color mapping.</p>

<p>To flip the colors, I'd like to introduce the color bar editing
tool:</p>
<p>(1) Locate the Color Bar editing tool in the bottom right corner
and select the "Copy" radio button.</p>
<p>(2) Click on the blue-to-white color gradient.</p>
<p>(3) Click on the "Paste" button, then click on the second row
of the Color Bar editing tool. This should paste a copy of the 
blue-to-white color bar to the second row of the editing tool.</p>
<p>(4) Click the "Edit" radio button, then click the second color 
bar (our new blue-to-white copy). This will bring up an editing 
popup.</p>
<p>(5) Hit the "reverse" button. This will give us a white-to-blue
gradient. Then hit the close "X" in the top right corner.</p>
<p>(6) At the top of the fourth color channel, click in the 
blue-to-white color bar. This will bring up a selection of color 
bars that include the white-to-blue bar which we just created. You
should be able to see the fold-lines are now the color white.</p>

<p>However, we are not done yet! The flipping of the color mapping 
means we will no longer be summing our four channels together. 
Channels 1, 2, and 3 will continue to use the blue-to-white color
mapping. Channel 4's noise value will be applied to the white-to-blue
mapping. Thus, we will have to merge these two in the 2nd stage of
the mixer.</p>

<p>And indeed, the mixer has segregated channel 3 into a separate 
track for us. What I suggest is the following: make the input signal
to the 2nd stage as strong as possible by setting channel 3's first
slider to 64. Then, nudge up 2nd stage slider for channel three to 
a point where the blended texture pleases you. I happen to like a
volume of "3" at this point.</p>

<p>The visual effect can be seen in the following figure. I've 
included the channel 3 settings and mixer settings in the figure.
I like these clouds a lot, but perhaps you might wish to tweak it
in another direction. As you can probably tell, the scope for 
tweaking and experimentation is considerable.</p>

<p><i><b>Fig. 1c, Cirrus clouds from Classic clouds, with added 
turbulent noise at a high octave. Also shown are channel and mixer
settings.</b></i></p>
<img SRC="../images/cirrusStep3.JPG" width="600" height="820" hspace="10"
vspace="10" ALT="Cirrus Step 3"/>

<p>Every transform has a procedural step behind it. Coding a 
heterodox texture like this does involve more bookkeeping than
sticking with a purely fractal and consistent setup. But it does 
allow for the creation of unique and expressive textures.</p>
